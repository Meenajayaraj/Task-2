## Difference between document and window object

`Document object`

When an HTML document is loaded into a web browser, it becomes a document object.

The document object is the root node of the HTML document.

The document object is a property of the window object.

```
document.property_name;
```

`Window Object`

*The window object represents an open window in a browser.

* If a document contain frames (<iframe> tags), the browser creates one window object for the HTML document, and one additional window object for each frame.

_syntx_

```
window.property_name;
```
